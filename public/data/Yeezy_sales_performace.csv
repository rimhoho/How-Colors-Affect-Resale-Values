While the original colorway featured a bright orange (officially Solar Red) stripe across the side, the 2017 release of the Yeezy Beluga colorway is much more subtle. This colorway utilizes the same Zebra-like stripes as the original but the SPLY-350 branding is the only part of the upper with a contrasted color-this time called Bold Orange. The Yeezy Beluga 2.0 nickname comes from the similarities to the earlier colorway but the official colorway of this adidas Yeezy release is Grey, Bold Orange, and Dark Grey. The toned down color combo made it an appealing shoe for the masses compared to some previous Yeezy colorways. Despite rumors suggesting an October drop, the official release date for the Beluga 2.0 was November 25th, 2017. Since then it has been one of the most active sneakers on StockX, continually selling well above its retail price.

This colorway steps outside of the comfort zone of previous 350 Yeezy sneaker releases, which have remained subtle and mostly neutral primary colors and bright accents.  The official colorway of the 'Frozen Yellow Yeezys' is actually Semi Frozen Yellow, Raw Steel and Red and features both of adidas pinnacle technologies, Boost cushioning and Primeknit sock-like upper. The hype for the yellow colored Yeezys was pushed to the roof before launch as Kanye West appeared with Kid Cudi and Takashi Murakami as 'Ye and Cudi toured the iconic artist's studio on a trip to Tokyo. In addition, the rumors throughout the sneaker world suggested the Frozen Yellow Yeezy would be an extremely hard to get release. As expected, the Semi Frozen Yellow was announced officially on November 13th, 2017 and released in limited quantities on November 18th, 2017.
