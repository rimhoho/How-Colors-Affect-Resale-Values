## How Colors Affect Resale Values [💻Link](https://how-colors-affect.herokuapp.com/)

"Scraped [StockX.com](https://stockx.com/search/adidas/yeezy/release-date?s=yeezy) sales data and visualized a color cluster map"

How Colors Affect Resale Values is a personal project where I experiment with data-driven, interactive explorations with my interests. It began when I was using data viz and data science tools to understand user behavior, and started playing around with sneakers data in my spare time.

Yeezy is noted for its signature earth tones and pastel highlights colors, but, some Yeezy fans in the community argue that their colorways are deliberately similar or identifiable from one another. So, I decided to track the color difference to see how close to each other. And if some majority colorways exist, I would follow how the colorways are actually performed by tracking the criteria of sale values.
